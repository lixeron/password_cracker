A very simple password cracker and the first one I have ever made (it likely sucks, but it does the job for a basic password like 1234)
Meant to be used for Linux OS (I performed on my Kali OS)
DO NOT USE FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES, It is not my responsibility if it is used illegaly. This is meant for educational purposes to understand how important it is to have MFA and a good strong password.
It uses hash to find the password/crack it. 
To use (On a permissible device like your own):
Root permissions to run the hash retrieval part of the script in linux/unix
IN the code change to needed.
It is brute force so the longer and more stronger the password, it's gonna take forever, but if it's like 1234 it will find it based off the txt file.
b1gman! is just a random example i came up with.
